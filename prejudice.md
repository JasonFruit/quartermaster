A Biblical Case Against Prejudice
======================================================================

### Leviticus 19:15

> 15 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not
  respect the person of the poor, nor honour the person of the mighty:
  but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

### Revelation 5:6-10

> 6 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four
  beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been
  slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven
  Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.  7 And he came and
  took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne.
  8 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and
  twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of them
  harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the prayers of
  saints.  9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take
  the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and
  hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and
  tongue, and people, and nation; 10 And hast made us unto our God
  kings and priests: and we shall reign on the earth.

### Galatians 26-29

> 26 For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.  27
  For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on
  Christ.  28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond
  nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in
  Christ Jesus.  29 And if ye be Christ’s, then are ye Abraham’s seed,
  and heirs according to the promise.
